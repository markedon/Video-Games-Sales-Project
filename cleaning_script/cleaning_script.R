# So critic_score has by far the most NAs, which is 77% of the sales data. With that many, I think it's worth dropping the column, 
# because I don't want more than 3/4 of the data to be imputed. 

# The next highest proportion of NAs is jp_sales. It has twice as many NA values as na_sales and pal_sales. It also has more than 
# half of its data missing, so I think I'll drop that column too. It wasn't particularly correlated with global_sales either, so I'm 
# not too bothered by that. In addition, I wouldn't use it if I were making a model to predict whether a game is going to be successful
# since you couldn't put any sales in for a theoretical game that's yet to be produced. 

# There's only 5605 missing esrb_ratings. That's not wholly terrible. Plus, since the data is categorical, it's possible to allocate NA
# to it's own category. 

# There are 3 missing values in the developer column. Since there aren't many, and the data is categorical, I'm going to leave them in.
